COMP40 Universal Machine in rust!

Includes two executables which can be made with
```
cargo build --release
```

Upon running, `um` and `ums` will be generated and can be run as
`ums <ums_file>*`
`um <um_file>`


## umsgrammar
`ums` files are generated by the following grammar

```
<binop> ::= + | * | / | nand
<reg> ::= rNN, where NN is any decimal number (one numeral per N)
<reserved> ::= if | m | map | unmap | out | in | <reg> | halt
<k> ::= <hex-literal> | <decimal-literal> | <character-literal> not reserved
<instr> ::= 
    <reg> := <reg> <binop> <reg>
  | <reg> := m[<reg>][<reg>]
  | <reg> := <reg> if <reg>
  | <reg> := map <reg>
  | <reg> := <k>
  | unmap <reg>
  | out <reg> 
  | in <reg>
  | m[<reg>][<reg>] := <reg>
  | goto m[<reg>][<reg>]
  | halt
```
